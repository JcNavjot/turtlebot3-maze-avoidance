# turtlebot3-maze-avoidance

In this project, the main aim was to get the turtlebot3 out of maze, I successfully implemented this project using python3 with ROS(ROBOT OPERATING SYSTEM). First the robot control class was used which was provided by robot ignite academy. Then I compiled my own script using the robot_control_class module functions provided by theconstruct.com. The laser was used to find out the distance of the frot side of the robot from the wall and the behaviour was changed accordingly.
